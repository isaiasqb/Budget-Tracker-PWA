# Budget-Tracker-PWA
a budget tracker application that has been updated to allow for offline access and functionality.

## The Task
The challange of this project was to update an existing budget tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality. The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. If the user enters transactions offline, the total should be updated when they're brought back online. 

The app is deployed to Heroku.
